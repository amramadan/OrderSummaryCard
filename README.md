## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first attempt to create a responsive development. I learned more about flexbox.

### Continued development

I plan on returning to this card and adding a description on the back so when you click a "flip-button" you can flip it read further details (maybe terms and conditions).


### Useful resources

- [A Complete guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with flexbox alignments (self and items).
